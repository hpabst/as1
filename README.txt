This is the README for the CMPUT301 assignment 1 Android counter app.
It is a basic app that provides a GUI for the user to manipulate a collection
of counters by viewing individual counters, incrementing them, viewing
statistics regarding the frequency of when the counter was incremented,
removing indiviual counters from the aggregate list, and
sorting the collection of counters according to their counts.

A UML diagram is included that provides an overview of the various
classes used and their interactions between each other and the user.

Code used is mostly my own with a few methods being used from other sources.
The sources are locally detailed in the code itself as well as being aggregated
